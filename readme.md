# CloudKeys Documentation

CloudKeys is a powerful npm package that allows you to generate and manage secure cloud access keys. This documentation will guide you through the installation process and show you how to create a script for generating cloud access keys.

## Installation

To use CloudKeys in your project, you'll need to install it as a dependency. You can do this using npm. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm install cloudkeys
```

This will download and install the CloudKeys package in your project.

## Generating Cloud Access Keys

Once you have CloudKeys installed, you can create a script in your project that will use CloudKeys to generate cloud access keys. Follow these steps to create the script:

1. Open your project's package.json file.

2. Locate the scripts section in the package.json file. If it doesn't exist, create one. It should look something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
"start": "node ."
}
```

1. Add a new script entry called generate and set its value to cloudkeys -g. This will execute the cloudkeys command with the -g flag to generate the cloud access keys.
   Your package.json should now look like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node .",
  "generate": "cloudkeys -g"
}
```

1. Save the package.json file.

# Using the generate Script

With the generate script defined, you can now use it to generate cloud access keys. To do this, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
npm run generate
```

The npm run command is used to execute scripts defined in the package.json file. In this case, it will run the generate script, which will invoke CloudKeys to generate your cloud access keys.

And that's it! You have successfully installed CloudKeys and created a script to generate cloud access keys for your project. You can now use these access keys to securely interact with various cloud services.

Remember to keep your access keys safe and avoid sharing them in public repositories or insecure channels. It's always a good practice to store them as environment variables in a secure manner.

For more details and advanced usage options, you can refer to the official CloudKeys documentation and npm package page.

Happy cloud key generation!
